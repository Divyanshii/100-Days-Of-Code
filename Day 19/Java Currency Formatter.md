Given a double-precision number, , denoting an amount of money, use the NumberFormat class' getCurrencyInstance method to convert  into the US, Indian, Chinese, and French currency formats. Then print the formatted values as follows:

US: formattedPayment
India: formattedPayment
China: formattedPayment
France: formattedPayment
where  is  formatted according to the appropriate Locale's currency.

Note: India does not have a built-in Locale, so you must construct one where the language is en (i.e., English).
